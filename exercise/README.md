### Project Overview 

#### Radar Range Equation

Using the Radar Range equation we can design the radar transmitter, receiver, and antenna to have the desired power, gain and noise performance to meet the range requirements.

A long range radar designed to cover 300m range and detect a target with smaller cross section would need higher transmit power and more antenna gain as compared to a short range radar designed to cover just 50m for similar target. 

A target with higher cross section can be detected at a longer range as compared to a target with smaller cross section.
